# SecureCTF

Welcome to **SecureCTF**, the new Capture The Flag platform. With a proudly elegant design crafted with [React](https://react.dev/) and a robust backend powered by [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), this platform claims to be an impenetrable stronghold of security.

Your mission is to delve into its depths, test its limits, and verify the truth of this claim. **Can you manage to expose its hidden vulnerabilities?**

## Application Overview

SecureCTF is a web-based Capture The Flag (CTF) platform that invites users to explore and identify deliberately implemented vulnerabilities on a web application. This platform serves as an excellent training ground for honing your web security and penetration testing skills. 

The platform is currently hosted and accessible via the following IP address:

ðŸ‘‰ **[http://148.113.205.172/](http://148.113.205.172/)**

Users are tasked with finding and exploiting vulnerabilities to capture flags. These challenges are designed to simulate real-world scenarios and help users develop their understanding of web application security.
